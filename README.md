# Mystery_Sorting

Project Description
 Sorting is used time and again in many day-to-day life activities. While brute force way to sort is easy to build and simple to apply in any situation, the cost of implementing brute force increases exponentially as the size and complexity of the data increases. So, in this project I'm implementing a method which uses only small amount of memory from the runtime and sorts a large dataset.
 
Dataset 
For this project I'm using the IMDb dataset. The file can be downloaded from the link https://drive.google.com/file/d/17j_CS6ai27c90nhqmAmBUHegj0KYQ9Uq/view?usp=sharing

imdb_dataset.csv file
The dataset file includes the following attributes as columns.

tconst – a unique identifier for each movie primaryTitle – the popular title that is used for   promotions originalTitle – original title in the original language
StartYear – release year of the title/ start year of a series runtimeMinutes – primary run time of title in minutes genres – includes up to three genres associated with the title averageRating – weighted average of all individual user ratings numVotes – number of votes the title has received ordering – a number to uniquely identify the rows for a given title category – the category of job that person was in seasonNumber – season number the episode belongs to
episodeNumber – episode number of tconst in the TV series primaryName – name by which the person is most often credited birthYear – in YYYY format deathYear – in YYYY format if applicable, else ‘\N’
PrimaryProfession – top 3 professions of the person

Output File:
For the testcases in the code for the regular sorting algorithms, compare the output with the output from the file downloaded from the provided link and paste that in the sorting algorithms folder.

How to RUN:
1. Download the dataset from the provided link.
2. In the project folder, copy the code file and the dataset file.
3. Create two empty folders named Individual and Final which stores the sorted Individual files and then the entire sorted data in a file containing 2000 records each.
4. Run the code using suitable editor.
